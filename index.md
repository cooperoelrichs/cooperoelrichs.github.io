## About Me
I graduated Civil Engineering before moving into the transport modelling field where I worked as a model developer and analyst. Transport modelling involves the combination of statistical and physical models of the behaviour of people and transport systems. Developing and improving these models requires skills in software engineering, data science, and mathematical modelling. The types of models used range in complexity from traditional statistical regressions to recent developments in machine learning or AI models such as random forests and neural networks.

After working in transport modelling for 4 years I transitioned to working as data scientist and machine learning engineer, developing my own projects and consulting for businesses. As a consultant I have worked developing financial models of businesses. My personal business projects have involved collecting and analysing large real estate datasets and using those datasets to train machine learning models that predict pricing and other housing attributes in Australia. This project is ongoing.

I have worked pro bono as the treasurer of SIES since 2015. My work with SIES has also involved volunteering on various projects as required. Examples of my work include writing and editing grant applications and providing data science skills to the project teams, such as collecting and analysing satellite imagery to monitor fires in national parks where SIES operates.

In my spare time I test my machine learning skills in Kaggle competitions, improving my programming skills by programming meetups, and honing my competitive gaming skills in online strategy games.

## Professional Experience

### Bachelor of Civil Engineering (1st Class Hons) from The University of Queensland
**2008 - 2012**
Received the AECOM Scholarship in Civ. Eng., the premier scholarship awarded by UQ's Civ. Eng. school.

### AECOM (Professional Experience Intern) 2011
###EarthCheck (Environmental benchmarking of business operations) 2011 - 2012

### Veitch Lister Consulting (Transport Modeller)
**2012 - 2016**

[http://www.veitchlister.com.au](http://www.veitchlister.com.au)
VLC is a specialist Australian transport modelling consultancy.
My work included: analysing transport related data sets, for example census data, spatial transport network data, and temporal public transport and traffic timetable data; developing transport related models - from nested logistic regressions of individual mode choice to dynamic traffic assignment models; and developing the software required to perform these tasks and presenting the results to VLC's clients. VLC strived to stay on the leading edge of transport modelling by excelling at data science and statistical modelling, at VLC I was involved in researching and developing the use of machine learning models in transport modelling.

### Save Indonesian Endangered Species Fund (SIES) (Treasurer)
**2015 - 2018**

[http://www.siesfund.org](http://www.siesfund.org)
SIES is an incorporated not-for-profit organisation, staffed entirely by volunteers, which supports conservation in Indonesia - Sumatra, Kalimantan, and Eastern Indonesia. My responsibilities include accounting, financial reporting, writing project proposals and grant applications, and providing data science and modelling assistance on projects as required.

### Real Estate Modelling Business Development Project (Data Scientist, Software Engineer, and Modeller)
**2016 - 2018**

[Developing a model to isolate the effect of location on property value](https://medium.com/@c.oelrichs/developing-a-model-to-isolate-the-effect-of-location-on-property-value-79f6ff345980)
This project uses automated data collection and machine learning to predict property value and rental yield. Data is scraped from various websites and collected into a single database of property sales and rentals. The database is used to analyse and map historical trends and to develop and train a range of machine learning models including logistic regressions, random forest models, and neural networks.
